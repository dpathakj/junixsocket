#summary Instructions for building junixsocket from Source

= Quick Start =

Just run the `build.xml` ant script:
{{{
   ant
}}}

If you get an error, first of all check if the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and points to the correct JDK directory. You may override this setting by specifying the ant property "jdk.home", e.g.

{{{
   ant -Djdk.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
}}}

= Platform-specific Notes =

== Linux ==

If you are running Fedora, RHEL or CentOS, you probably need to install ant-nodeps (for the `javah` ant target):

{{{
   yum -y install ant-nodeps
}}}

== Mac OS X ==

It should work without installing additional software.

Tested on Leopard (10.5) and Snow Leopard (10.6). Leopard-PPC untested.

== Other Platforms ==

In order to use junixsocket, a native JNI library needs to be compiled. This inherently is platform-specific. The binary distribution already provides code for Mac OS X and Linux (both Intel 32-bit and 64-bit). 

junixsocket probably runs on other Unixoid systems (Solaris maybe?), but that has not been tested. You need to change `build.xml` a little, and it should build. If not, you will have to modify the [http://code.google.com/p/junixsocket/source/browse/trunk/junixsocket/src/main/org/newsclub/net/unix/org_newsclub_net_unix_NativeUnixSocket.c JNI C code].
