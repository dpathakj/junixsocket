#summary Instructions for building junixsocket from Source

= Quick Start =

Just run the `build.xml` ant script:
{{{
   ant
}}}

= Platform-specific Notes =

== Linux ==

If you are running Fedora, RHEL or CentOS, you probably need to install ant-nodeps (for the `javah` ant target):

{{{
   yum -y install ant-nodeps
}}}

== Mac OS X ==

It should work without installing additional software.

== Other Platforms ==

In order to use junixsocket, a native JNI library needs to be compiled. This inherently is platform-specific. The binary distribution already provides code for Mac OS X and Linux (both Intel 32-bit and 64-bit). 

junixsocket probably runs on other Unixoid systems (Solaris maybe?), but that has not been tested. You need to change `build.xml` a little, and it should build. If not, you will have to modify the [http://code.google.com/p/junixsocket/source/browse/trunk/junixsocket/src/main/org/newsclub/net/unix/org_newsclub_net_unix_NativeUnixSocket.c JNI C code].
